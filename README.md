## Data Collection

Data was scraped from the [VNL 2022 website](https://en.volleyballworld.com/volleyball/competitions/vnl-2022/). BeautifulSoup and Requests-HTML libraries were used for the web scrappers. The code can be found on the scripts folder of the project.

## Data Preparation

The data collected was processed using Pandas. This can be found on the notebook 01-preprocessing.ipynb. Data was condensed into two separate csv files: one for individual statistics and the other for team statistics.
